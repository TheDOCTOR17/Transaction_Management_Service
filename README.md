This repository contains a simple task management application implemented using Spring Boot. The application provides RESTful API endpoints for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks.

Features:
- **Task Entity**: The application defines a `Task` entity with attributes such as `id`, `title`, and `description`. The `id` is auto-generated by the database upon insertion.
- **RESTful API**: The application exposes RESTful API endpoints for managing tasks, including:
  - GET `/api/tasks`: Retrieve all tasks.
  - GET `/api/tasks/{id}`: Retrieve a task by its ID.
  - POST `/api/tasks`: Create a new task.
  - PUT `/api/tasks/{id}`: Update an existing task.
  - DELETE `/api/tasks/{id}`: Delete a task.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Tasks are stored in a PostgreSQL database using Spring Data JPA. The `TaskRepository` interface extends `JpaRepository` to perform CRUD operations.
- **Service Layer**: A `TaskService` class provides business logic for managing tasks, including methods for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving tasks.
- **Controller Layer**: The `TaskController` class defines RESTful endpoints and handles HTTP requests by delegating to the `TaskService`.
- **Error Handling**: The application handles errors such as resource not found (404) gracefully, returning appropriate HTTP responses.
- **Postman Collection**: A Postman collection is included for testing the API endpoints.

This project serves as a simple example of building a RESTful web service using Spring Boot, demonstrating best practices for structuring a Spring Boot application and implementing CRUD operations for managing tasks. Feel free to explore the code and contribute to enhance the application's functionality or add new features.
